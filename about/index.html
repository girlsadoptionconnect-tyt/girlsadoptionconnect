      <p>
        Girls Adoption Connect is an online community that connects adoptees through the sharing of adoption stories and thoughts about adoption. All content submissions that have adoption as the central theme are welcome. Through this shared media, the goal is to create an environment where adoptees feel heard, understood, and validated.

        Girls Adoption Connect was founded in 2020 by Téa Tamburo after reconnecting with the group of girls she was adopted alongside from Hunan, China. She mailed letters to the girls in her group, asking to get to know each other 15 years after their adoption. All had different adoption stories, but coming from the same orphanages and city in Hunan, they began exchanging stories and experiences about adoption, family, and identity.

        This sharing of stories gave Téa a feeling of belonging and validation, and she wanted to create a space for others to meet adoptees like themselves. Hoping to connect with the larger adopted community, Téa started Girls Adoption Connect with the support of those from her group.
