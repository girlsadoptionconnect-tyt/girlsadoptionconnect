Chinese people were the first group excluded from entering the United States. Yet, this is something that often is not mentioned. In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed, which was the first significant law restricting immigration in the U.S.. Then in 1924 the Immigration Act was passed, which prohibited immigration from Asia. This act also barred immigration from Japan, violating the Gentleman’s Agreement, that previously protected Japanese immigration from legal restrictions. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943, with the goal of aiding World War Two. While both of these acts drastically changed the courses of many lives, these events are often overlooked.
