Hello! My name is Kalila James, and I was adopted from Shijiazhuang Shi, Hebei, China when I was 10 months old. I am currently 25.

Being adopted has definitely shaped who I am today. I have always appreciated my culture and where I come from. It’s allowed me to explore more about myself. However, growing up, I struggled a lot with identity crisis, bullying and racist comments due to my situation. It was hard to find a place I belonged in.

As an adult, I have connected with many other adoptees who have shared similar experiences. It’s been wonderful to feel a sense of community and find people who understand the struggles and challenges of being adopted. I continue to reclaim my sense of self and come to peace that being adopted is a part of myself.
