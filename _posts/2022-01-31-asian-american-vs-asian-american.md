<h4>Slide text</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    <strong>Title:</strong> Asian American versus Asian-American.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The second version (“Asian-American”) is hyphenated; the first (“Asian American”) is not.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>Title:</strong> What is a hyphen?<br>
    A hyphen is “-” and is typically seen in adjective–noun relationships. Basically, the first word modifies the second word. Words before the noun modify the noun itself. Hyphens are not used to join adverb–noun phrases.<br>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> user-generated, pet-friendly, closely related (unhyphenated).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>Title:</strong> Asian American (unhyphenated)<br>
    The unhyphenated version of “Asian American” emphasizes neither the “Asian” nor “American” identity, so both identities are equally emphasized in this style choice.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>Title:</strong> Asian-American (hyphenated)<br>
    With the hyphen, “Asian” is modifying “American,” so “Asian” would be more prominently emphasized over “American.”
  </li>
</ul>
