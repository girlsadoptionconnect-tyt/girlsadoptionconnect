    <strong>23andMe to be acquired by Regeneron</strong><br><br>

    What you need to know about the 23andMe sale.<br><br>

    23andMe has agreed to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company, for $256 million. According to the press release, “23andMe intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the sale process.”<br><br>

    Regeneron will acquire most of 23andMe’s assets, including its Personal Genome Service (DNA testing) and research divisions. Regeneron has pledged to uphold 23andMe’s existing privacy policies and comply with all applicable data protection laws.<br><br>

    A bankruptcy court hearing to consider approval of the transaction is scheduled for June 17. If approved, the deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025.

    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>Bankruptcy claims notice from 23andMe</strong><br><br>

    When a company files for bankruptcy, it begins a legal process to manage its debts and respond to claims.<br><br>

    <strong>The filing:</strong> On March 23, 2025, 23andMe and 11 related companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This allows the company to reorganize its debts under court protection.<br><br>

    <strong>The claims:</strong> If you were affected by the October 2023 data breach or believe you are owed something, you may be eligible to file a claim. There are two claim types: one related to the cyber incident and one for other general claims.<br><br>

    <strong>The deadline:</strong> July 14, 2025 is the final day to submit a proof of claim. If you do not file by this date, you may lose the right to participate in any payout or settlement.

    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>Official claims notice from 23andMe</strong><br><br>

    <em>In re: 23andMe Holding Co., et al.<br>
    Chapter 11 – Case No. 25-40976-357 (Jointly Administered)</em><br><br>

    On March 23, 2025, 23andMe Holding Co. and 11 debtor subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Eastern District of Missouri.<br><br>

    The court established deadlines (“Bar Dates”) for customers to file proofs of claim. This notice was sent to all current and former customers to explain how to determine whether they have a claim and how to file it. Receiving this notice does not necessarily mean a claim exists.<br><br>

    There are two claim packages:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cyber Security Incident Bar Date Package:</strong> Applies to customers affected by the October 2023 data breach who incurred monetary or non-monetary damages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>General Bar Date Package:</strong> Applies to any other claims unrelated to the cyber incident.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Customers with multiple claim types must file separate claims. Failure to submit a claim by July 14, 2025 may result in the waiver of rights to any future distributions.<br><br>
