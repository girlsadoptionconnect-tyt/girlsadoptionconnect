    <strong>Bankruptcy claims notice from 23andMe</strong><br><br>

    <strong>Official Claims Notice</strong><br><br>
    <div class="slide-notes">

<strong>In re:</strong> 23andMe Holding Co., et al.<br>
<strong>Chapter 11 – Case No. 25-40976-357 (Jointly Administered)</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>TO:</strong> All Current and Former Customers of 23andMe Holding Co. and its Debtor Subsidiaries (the “Debtors”):
</p>

<p>
On March 23, 2025, 23andMe Holding Co. and 11 debtor subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) each filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Eastern Division (the “Court”).
</p>

<p>
The Court has entered an order (the “Bar Date Order”) setting deadlines (each, a “Bar Date” and collectively, the “Bar Dates”) for filing proofs of claim or requests for payment of certain administrative expenses in these Chapter 11 cases.
</p>

<p>
This notice (the “Notice of Instruction”) is being provided to all current and former customers of 23andMe Holding Co. and its subsidiaries, including Lemonaid Health (collectively, “23andMe”), and is intended to provide such customers with additional information to assist in determining if you have a claim and filing proofs of claim. This notice will also be filed with the Court and accessible via the public docket. Receipt of this notice does not necessarily mean that you have a claim.
</p>

<p>
There are two claim packages (each, a “Bar Date Package” and collectively, the “Bar Date Packages”): the General Bar Date Package and the Cyber Security Incident Bar Date Package.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
IF YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS NOTICE AND BELIEVE YOU HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBTOR, YOU MUST SUBMIT THE APPLICABLE PROOF OF CLAIM FORMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH BELOW ON OR BEFORE JULY 14, 2025.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>
THE FAILURE TO TIMELY SUBMIT ANY PROOF OF CLAIM ON OR BEFORE JULY 14, 2025 MAY RESULT IN THE WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO ASSERT YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE DEBTORS AND YOUR RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTIONS ON ACCOUNT OF ANY SUCH CLAIMS UNDER A CHAPTER 11 PLAN IN THESE CASES.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Each of the Bar Date Packages corresponds to a specific type of claim. The following instructions are provided to determine which Bar Date Package applies to you:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cyber Security Incident Bar Date Package.</strong><br>
This package applies only if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You were a customer of 23andMe between May 1, 2023 and October 1, 2023,</li>
  <li>You received notice from 23andMe that your personal information was compromised in a data breach discovered and disclosed in October 2023 (the “Cyber Security Incident”), and</li>
  <li>You incurred monetary or non-monetary damages related to the Cyber Security Incident.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If so, you may hold a cyber security incident claim (a “Cyber Security Incident Claim”) and are a potential “Cyber Security Incident Claimant.” The Cyber Security Incident Notice included in the Cyber Security Bar Date Package provides instructions you must follow to submit this type of claim.
</p>

<p>
<strong>General Bar Date Package.</strong><br>
This package applies if you believe you have any other claim against 23andMe and/or its subsidiaries that is not a Cyber Security Incident Claim. The General Bar Date Notice provides instructions you must follow to submit this type of claim.
</p>

<p>
If you believe you have a claim related to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DNA testing services:</strong> 23andMe, Inc. is the primary Debtor entity.</li>
  <li><strong>Telehealth services:</strong> Lemonaid Health, Inc. is the primary Debtor entity.</li>
  <li><strong>Mail order pharmacy services:</strong> LPRXOne, LLC is the primary Debtor entity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you believe you have both a Cyber Security Incident Claim and any other type of claim, you must submit separate proofs of claim for each.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional information for Cyber Security Incident Claimants:</strong><br>
A settlement has been preliminarily and conditionally approved in the multidistrict litigation pending before the Honorable Edward M. Chen in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (MDL No. 3098). This class action is currently stayed due to these Chapter 11 cases and is not final.
</p>

<p>
To preserve your claim, you must submit a proof of claim in accordance with the Cyber Security Bar Date Package. Failure to do so may result in waiver of participation in any future distributions.
