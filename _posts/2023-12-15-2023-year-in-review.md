{% include youtube.html id="k8szk6Qfhg4" title="A year in review: 23 posts to recap 2023" %}

It's almost 2024! In the past year, Girls Adoption Connect has shared over 30 adoptees' spotlights, eight informative posts about identity and reached over 2,000 members in the adoptee community. This year, community chats were also created. So far these chats connected over 250 adoptees with adoptees from 13 countries and provinces.

Given that 42 pieces have been published in the span of 50 weeks, Girls Adoption Connect will be resurfacing some of the year's highlights here and on Instagram stories. Starting tomorrow, and running through Dec. 31, tune in to revisit some of the highlights from the year!

Some of the pieces that will be resurfacing:

<ul>
  <li>Adoptee spotlight: Kaitlyn Rewis</li>
  <li>My DNA testing journey &amp; results</li>
  <li>Adoptee spotlight: Maggie Yu Walker</li>
  <li>Current effects of the one-child policy</li>
</ul>
