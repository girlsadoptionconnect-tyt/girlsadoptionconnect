Hi, my name is Joycelyn. I was adopted in 2007 from Fengcheng, Jiangxi, China when I was 13-months-old. The orphanage gave me the name 丰可盈 (Fēng kě yíng). I now live in Maryland in the United States and am entering my last year of high school.

I was abandoned at the gate of my orphanage as a newborn baby and was discovered by a staff member who took me in. Though it's been 16 years since I was adopted, I am hoping that I can one day return to visit my hometown, orphanage and my finding spot. In the future, I plan on taking a DNA test and starting a search for my biological parents. Though reunions don't occur often, I would love to be able to meet my birth parents and family!   

Currently, I live in a community with a large Asian population (but I've only met one other Asian adoptee). I was adopted by a Chinese family, so I've grown up with Chinese culture and speak Cantonese at home; I also learned Mandarin for 11 years.   

Thank you so much for reading my story.
