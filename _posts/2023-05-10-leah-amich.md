I'm Leah Amich, and I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. I was adopted when I was 2.5-years-old and grew up around the Waukesha, Wisconsin area.

I am passionate about mental health and wellness. I am a helper by nature and like to think of myself as a wounded healer. Currently, I'm pursuing my masters degree in clinical mental health counseling, with the goal of working with adoptees and addiction in my future practice. My goal is to educate and spread awareness to the mental health community about the reality of adoption and how to best help adoptees.   

I’m now 28-years-old and I’ve been “out of the fog” for about two years. Two of my closest friends are fellow adoptees. I love this community of adoptees. We have a fire inside of us that has been silenced for too long and have a bond, mission and vision for change, and I am so excited to be a part of it.
