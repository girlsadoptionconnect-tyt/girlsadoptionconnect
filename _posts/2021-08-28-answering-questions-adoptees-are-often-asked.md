Answering Questions Adoptees Are Often Asked
Asked by those not adopted, answered by us!

### Question: Do adoptees want to have contact with their birth families?

Answers:

- I would love to know who my biological parents are, but I also don't want to. — *Chloe*

- I'd like to have answers about why I wasn't kept, but I'm not sure I'd want contact beyond that. I was placed at the orphanage when I was a day old, so they'd practically be strangers to me. Everyone feels differently about this though. — *Téa*

- I would, but I know there's a slim chance for me to contact my birth family. — *Monica*

- Yes, I just want to know who I resemble and the culture. But I don't know if I would want to be close. — *Ella*

- When I was younger, I had no interest in my birth family. Looking back, that probably came from a place of hurt. I did a heritage tour to China in 2017, and I was just past the age cut off to see my records, because they said they didn’t have 1996 and before in the computers. It’s something I think about more often now. — *Katie B.*


### Question: How do you feel about DNA testing to find biological family members?

Answers:

- I did it. It can be rewarding but also disheartening. — *Ella*

- I've yet to take a DNA test, but I would like to. The chances of finding someone I'm related to are slim, so I have conflicted feelings about trying, since I have a great family that adopted me. I'd be more likely to do a test to learn my ancestry and geographical DNA. — *Téa*

- I like it but am scared to find my birth parents. — *Lily*

- I find it really awesome that science allows us to have this cool opportunity. — *Monica*

- I've done DNA testing but not to find biological family members. But I thought it was cool. — *Katie K.*


### Question: What are some adoption-related stereotypes you face?

Answers:

- Them: “So you can speak Mandarin?!”  
  Me: “A few words. Does that count?” — *Bronwyn*

- That our mothers were poor, lazy, drug addicts. Also that being adopted is always great or better for the kid. — *Rebecca*

- Not necessarily a stereotype, but people saying “real” parents instead of “biological.” — *Elisa*

- When I was little, I attended a mainly white school and was the only one that’s adopted. A lot of kids would ask me if I knew my biological parents, knew Mandarin, if my parents were white, if I knew my “real” parents. My parents were asked how much I cost, if they bought me, and that I was lucky to get adopted. — *Mai Li*


### Question: Do some adoptees have difficulties dating because of imposter syndrome?

Answers:

- Possibly! I have been struggling with imposter syndrome, and I'm seeing how it has affected me. — *Mia*

- Oh yes. Dating a man my ethnicity felt like I was fetishizing him at first. — *Rebecca*

- Yes, definitely. I haven't tried dating yet, but I do have these thoughts. — *Ella*

- For sure, but we need to remember that true love will outstand the odds. (Speaking from a girl that has also had childhood leukemia three times, which adds a whole new dimension.) Plus, they'll be able to celebrate more traditions, which is always exciting — ’cause who doesn't like Lunar New Year?! — *Bronwyn*
