Every year, November is recognized as National Adoption Awareness Month. The particular focus is the adoption of children currently in foster care and promoting awareness for the need of adoptive families. Throughout the month, adoption is celebrated as a positive way to build families, therefore we will be sharing stories about our own adoption experiences throughout the next few weeks.
