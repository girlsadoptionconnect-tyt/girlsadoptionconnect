Hi, my name is Katherine Mitchell. I was born November 29, 2005 and I was adopted on October 11, 2006 in LeChang, Guangdong. The name I was given in my orphanage was Lu Xiao Qing, and my nickname was Qing Qing. In my group, I was the easy-going baby and they didn’t really give me much attention.

I live in Tennessee, and thankfully, most people don’t really care that I’m Asian. I try and connect with my Chinese heritage as much as I can; I love the food. I also used to play soccer, since I was 3 years old, but I injured my knee and I had to get surgery. I had an amazing team with me, and we were all like a family. One of my biggest passions is singing. I love music, and it helps me feel better. I have recently started learning to play the guitar. I hope to learn how to speak Mandarin and Cantonese and learn more about my Chinese heritage.
