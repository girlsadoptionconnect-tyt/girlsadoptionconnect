Hello, I’m Lilly. I’m 21 years old, and I was born in Zunyi, China. I was adopted when I was 15 months old. I don’t remember anything about my adoption, but I know I was left near a police station. I was taken to a foster home and was named "Zizhu" which means “purple bamboo.” My adoptive parents, who I call my parents, kept that name as my middle name. 

I grew up an hour south of Atlanta with a diverse family. I have two sisters who are biologically related to each other and one sister was was adopted from Guatemala as a baby. My three sisters and I all grew up together and are very close. I’m grateful for my family.

I am now a senior in college, and my major is Sign Language Interpreting. I don’t have many Asian friends, because I was raised in a predominantly white area, so I’m excited to get to know and read more about Asian adoptees who can relate to me.
