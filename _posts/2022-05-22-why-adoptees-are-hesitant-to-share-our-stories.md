Slide descriptions:
Slide one: 

Why adoptees are hesitant to share our stories. Responses from the adoptee community.

Slide two: 

I was scared that people would think I wanted sympathy when I just wanted to be understood.

Slide three: 

I didn't want my experience as a Chinese American to be invalidated by my friends with Chinese families.

Slide four: 

I have experienced negative reactions and been told I'm not "truly Chinese," "not Asian enough" and have had my experiences ignored.

Slide five: 

I didn't want to be different from everyone else and stand out from the norm.
