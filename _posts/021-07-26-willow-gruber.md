Hey y’all! My name is Willow. I was born in Nanning, China on July 7. Three weeks later, my birth mother left me in a parking lot. The police found me and took me to a welfare institution where I spent the next three months until I was taken to a foster family, because I had an upper respiratory infection. 

My parents adopted me when I was nine months old. Later, we found out I have a disability called cerebral palsy. It affected my muscles and nervous system. I was unable to efficiently walk or talk without any problems, until I was about 10. I was only able to learn to walk and talk because of the therapy I was placed in. I had, and I still have, problems with my hand shaking and a bit of a speech slur but that's it. We believe that I had a stroke as a baby when my birth mother left me that caused all of the health problems I had. I am incredibly blessed to be place with a family who cared and has the means to take care of me.
