<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    <strong>What’s significant about the Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action?</strong><br>
    From Asian adoptees.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>Defining affirmative action</strong><br>
    Affirmative action is an effort made by colleges and universities to diversify their classes by factoring racial identity into admissions decisions.<br><br>
    Schools historically used affirmative action to admit a more racially diverse student body — statistically, mostly Black and Latinx students.<br><br>
    The goal was to give historically disadvantaged identities opportunities to obtain higher education.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>What recently happened</strong><br>
    On June 29, the Supreme Court voted 6–3 that race can no longer be a factor in college and university admissions.<br><br>
    Because selective schools have limited availability, Asian students alleged they were denied admission because of their race.<br><br>
    They claimed Harvard University and the University of North Carolina capped the number of Asian students admitted.<br><br>
    The Court ruled that race-conscious admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>By the numbers</strong><br>
    Percent of respondents who say race should be a major, minor, or not a factor in admissions. Data source: Pew Research Center.<br><br>
    Total: Major 7%, Minor 19%, Not a factor 74%<br>
    White: Major 4%, Minor 17%, Not a factor 79%<br>
    Black: Major 15%, Minor 24%, Not a factor 59%<br>
    Hispanic: Major 12%, Minor 19%, Not a factor 68%<br>
    Asian: Major 10%, Minor 27%, Not a factor 63%
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide five</strong><br>
    <strong>Asian adoptees’ responses</strong><br>
    “Appalling! I’m sick of seeing diasporic Asians being pawns in white supremacy.”<br><br>
    “There would be a lot more space for deserving students if legacies and children of donors weren’t considered ‘special.’”<br><br>
    “Asian Americans are being used to justify it when it’s hurting everyone, including us.”
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    <strong>Asian adoptees’ responses</strong><br>
    “It puts white and Asian people on one side versus all other people of color.”<br><br>
    “I think it will be interesting with Caucasian parents adopting Asian children.”<br><br>
    “East Asians and Indians are being used as pawns to destroy a system that has helped many people.”
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide seven</strong><br>
    <strong>Asian adoptees’ responses</strong><br>
    “It’s another example of Asian people being painted as the antagonist.”<br><br>
    “Continuing to give advantages to legacies. Terrible.”<br><br>
    “It makes Asian people look apathetic to the needs of Black and brown people.”
