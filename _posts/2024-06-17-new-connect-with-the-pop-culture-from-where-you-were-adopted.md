## Introducing Current Culture Connections

You're invited to share media (music, movies, TV shows, books, etc) from the region you're adopted from to help make it easier for fellow adoptees to connect with the pop culture of their birth country!

If you don't see a tab for your region of adoption, email girlsadoptionconnect@gmail.com so one can be created.

As a Chinese adoptee living in the United States, I struggled to start finding current Chinese music and shows that appealed to my generation. I'm starting these lists to help make connecting to the current culture of our birth countries more easily accessible. Currently there are lists for Chinese and Korean media which will be updated as you submit your suggestions.
