In response to the ruling in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health:

This overturning is horrifying, and I feel like I’m still processing it. Growing up, my mom always told me that I was given up because I would have a better life with more freedom in the United States than I would have had in China. This includes reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, something women in China did not have when I was born. 

Even if that claim is only partially true, it’s disheartening to think that states in the United States are so eager and willing to repeal a woman’s right to bodily autonomy -- a right that I didn’t have in China and now may not have in the United States' future. It’s just sad to think that we all escaped a country with a government that told women what to do with their bodies only to end up in another that leaves it up to the states to feel entitled to our bodies.
