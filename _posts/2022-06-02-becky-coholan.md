Hi, my name is Becky, and I am a third-year student at Acadia University, working towards my bachelor of science in Psychology.  I am adopted from Wuchuan, Guangdong, China. I was adopted when I was 14 months old, and I have lived in Nova Scotia, Canada since then. For fun, I love to go for walks, be outdoors, having coffee dates with friends, try new food and read a good books. 

Throughout my life, I’ve had the privilege to continuously connect with my adoption group and surround myself with people who have experienced similar things as I have. This has helped me feel less alone and helped me to understand there are others who know the challenges of being a transracial adoptee.
