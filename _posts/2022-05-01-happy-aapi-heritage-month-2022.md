      <strong>Slide two:</strong><br>
      <strong>Why it is important</strong><br>
      AAPI people have a long history in the United States, despite the stereotype that they are “perpetual foreigners” and not truly American. AAPI communities have contributed significantly to many areas of American culture and society. This month honors the journeys, experiences, cultures, and traditions of AAPI people in the U.S.

      <strong>Slide three:</strong><br>
      <strong>Background on the month</strong><br>
      The effort to officially recognize AAPI contributions began in the late 1970s and took over ten years to become a dedicated month-long celebration. It originally began as a week and was officially recognized as a month in 1990.
