## Wishing you a Happy New Year from Girls Adoption Connect!

The past year has been a turbulent one for the Asian adoptive community. We connected with fellow adoptees when China ended international adoptions, educated the wider community about Korean adoption history, and continued raising awareness about DNA testing and the Asian American experience. Through all of this, I've had the utmost privilege of hosting this page to raise awareness and amplify our collective voices as adoptees.

Over the past year, it's been a joy to be a part of uniting and advocating for the adopted community. To everyone who have been supportive along the way: thank you for the opportunity to share my story as an adoptee and for the privilege of amplifying and advocating for adoptees' voices the past four and a half years. While complex, it was an honor and one of the highlights of my year to share responses from adoption agencies in September and seek answers for us all regarding the end to Chinese international adoption. When I started this community in 2020, I never imagined we'd be where we are. As we progress into the new year, more adoptees' spotlights and adoption content will be forthcoming. Cheers to 2025!

With love,

Téa Tamburo, Girls Adoption Connect founder
