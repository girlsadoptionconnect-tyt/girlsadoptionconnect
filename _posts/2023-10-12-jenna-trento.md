Hi, my name is Jenna Trento. When I was 9-months-old, I was adopted from Guangdong, China and moved to New Jersey. I was adopted into a multicultural family where I grew up celebrating Chinese New Year, learning how to cook Italian food and visiting with my Irish cousins. Growing up, I had to grow up fast to navigate through grief and losses that correlated with being adopted. 

I continue to process, feel, and enjoy what this second chance of life continues to offer me. Throughout my life, I have always been open to diversity and encountering new environments: meeting people of all different backgrounds. I like to travel, play golf and spend time with my loved ones.
