Hi! My name is Eva, and I am from Chifeng, China. Chifeng is in the inner Mongolia province, up north. I was born with a cleft lip and palate. I was adopted when I was 21-months-old and live close to Washington, DC. I enjoy listening to music and learning languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin in school, and I want to learn French, Cantonese and many more.

Growing up, I knew I was grappling with identity issues surrounding belonging. Being a transracial Chinese adoptee has brought insecurities around not feeling “Asian enough” for my peers. I am one of the officers for my school’s Chinese club. While being an officer and taking Chinese class, I often compare myself to my Chinese peers. Many of the Chinese students can speak their native tongue in ways I cannot. Not having a Chinese mother to teach me traditional Chinese recipes and other parts of Chinese culture puts me a step back from my peers.

Although I may always feel in between cultures, my insecurities on being “Asian” and adopted have given me so many good friends who share the same feelings. Although we don’t share the same story, it’s really nice having friends who can empathize with the challenge of being Asian in America.
