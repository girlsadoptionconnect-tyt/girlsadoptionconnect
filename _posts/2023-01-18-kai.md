Hi! My name is Kai, and I am currently a university student studying to be a future teacher. I was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. I was adopted by my parents when I was 11 months old; we celebrated our forever family day a few months ago. We currently live on the West Coast of Canada and enjoy the sun, rain and snow, depending on what mother nature sends our way.

Being adopted is just a part of my story, though, and it isn’t the only fun fact about me. I recently got back into playing soccer, I enjoy creative writing, when motivation hits, and I love reading romance novels. I also get really attached to TV shows like Grey’s Anatomy (yeah, I’m one of them lol).

My family and I enjoy traveling together when we can and going on hikes too. We also have two fur babies, Emiko and Panda. Laughter is the best medicine in our house, and it has gotten us through some tough times in the past couple of years. I’m proud of who I’ve become and the daughter my family has raised, despite everything that happened long before I can remember. Adoption is just a piece of my life puzzle that I add to every day.
