Aloha! My name is Amanda Lindsey, and I’m from Oahu, Hawaii! I was adopted from Guilin, China in 1998, a few days after my first birthday. According to the note that I was found with, I lived with my birth family for about a month before they couldn’t care for me anymore for what was said to be “family reasons." My birthday was also listed as well. I was sent to live in an orphanage for several months and then was transferred to a foster family for another few months once my adoption was finalized. I then was taken on a long train ride to Nanning, China to meet my new family. The orphanage named me Meiling, which my new family kept as my middle name.

Growing up I never really thought twice about being adopted since my parents were always very open about it and happy to answer any questions. I was also fortunate to grow up in diverse Hawaii, where Chinese culture is present in so many ways. However, I did attend a predominately white middle school and college, and I felt weird/awkward at times and was subject to uncomfortable questions. I felt like I had really lost my Asian American identity in college, and I struggled to fit in. Looking back, I should’ve tried to be more accepting of it and joined more cultural clubs, but at the time, I wanted nothing more than to not be Chinese and try to match my white last name.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve gotten more comfortable and connected with my identity. I attribute this to various Chinese cultural books, movies, etc. and getting more involved in the adoption community. As of now, I still remain slightly curious about my birth family but don't don’t have a strong desire to learn more. I just hope that they are at peace, just like I am, with my adoption.

For fun, I like to figure skate, dance ballet, cook and bake, listen to BTS, travel, learn languages, go shopping and spend time with family and friends! I currently work as a remote communications assistant and an English sign language tutor, and I hope to connect with more adoptees.
