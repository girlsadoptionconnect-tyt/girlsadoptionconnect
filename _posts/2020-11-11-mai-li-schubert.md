My name is Mai Li. I was adopted from Hunan, China in September 2005, when I was eight months old. I have a younger brother who was adopted from Taiwan. I haven’t been back to China, but I definitely want to go there sometime. I enjoy writing and reading fiction. I hope to learn more about my birth culture as I get older and meet other adoptees from China; I’ve already started to learn Chinese.
