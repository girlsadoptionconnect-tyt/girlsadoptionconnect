## Yiyang, Changsha --> Chicago, IL 

I’m Téa, and I was adopted from Hunan, Changsha China in 2005, when I was a baby. I am an only-child and the only Asian person in my family. I went back to the city of Changsha a few summers ago to tour my orphanage and to learn more about my past. 

During that visit, I met my primary caregiver and also the orphanage director who gave me my Chinese name. I also practiced speaking Mandarin, which I have been learning at school.

Since that visit, I have wanted to connect with other adoptees, so that is why I formed this group. At the end of 2019, I sent letters to adoptees that travelled to China with my parents, back in 2005. Besides forming connections with other adoptees, I enjoy journalism, tennis and fashion design.
