My name is Katie, and I am an adoptee from Chengdu, China. Not much is known about my biological family, but the orphanage knew I was abandoned in front of a police station. As soon as I was brought to the orphanage, the goal was to find me my forever home. 

At the age of 8 months, I was adopted by my mother and father in America. They legally changed my name from 侯琦羊 (Hóu qí yáng) to my forever name (Katie), and now I am super happy with my forever family. 

One thing that I am struggling with is finding people like me who understand the adoption trauma and loss. I love my parents and family, but, deep down, I feel like I’m missing a part of me that can’t be fixed. I am trying DNA sites and social media to see if I can find someone from my biological family. Being a Chinese adoptee and looking to find a connection to China, I'm hoping to make friends with people currently in the same situation as me.
