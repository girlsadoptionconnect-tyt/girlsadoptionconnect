Hi, I'm Chloe Miller, and I'm 22-years-old. In October 2002, I was adopted from Gansu, China, and I currently live in York, Pennsylvania. I grew up in an area without a large Chinese population. However, I joined a Chinese group, and the group and I grew up together. The group sort of lost contact once everyone grew up and were not able to meet as often. 

When I was 14-years-old, I took a 23&Me DNA test. Through this test, I met some distant cousins but no close relatives; the closest I have are third and fourth cousins. I'm currently searching for my biological family. I want to find my birth parents and relatives, so feel free to reach out if you think we might be related. While on a biological family search trip in 2019, I saw the mountains in Gansu province.
