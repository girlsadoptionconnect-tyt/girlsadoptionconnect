Happy International Women's Day! 

For many of us, being adopted and a woman are so closely interwoven. Because of China's One-Child Policy, girls were disproportionally placed at orphanages — I was one of those girls. I think often about how being a woman has shaped and continues to shape my life. This International Women's Day, I'm so grateful to share the pride-points of our community members' intersectional identities.
