Hey everyone! I'm Amy Smith. I was born in Hefei, China in 2000 and was left at the doorstop of the Hefei Welfare Institute.

My strong single mom adopted me in 2001 when I was12 months old. She adopted my little sister and I through Children’s Bridge! I was group 92 (groups 90,91,92 travelled together). I used to see my adoption group every year but lost touch about 10 years ago!

Now, I play competitive hockey and soccer and love sports! I’m currently 21 years old and live in Ontario, Canada. I attend Western University and am studying business and French.
