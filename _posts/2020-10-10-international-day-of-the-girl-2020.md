Today, Oct. 11, is International Day of the Girl! 25 years ago (1995), 30,000 men and women arrived in Beijing for the Fourth World Conference on Women, determined to recognize women’s rights as human rights. The conference brought about the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is the most comprehensive policy agenda for gender equality. International Day of the Girl focuses attention on a need to address challenges girls face and promote empowerment and fulfillment of their human rights.
