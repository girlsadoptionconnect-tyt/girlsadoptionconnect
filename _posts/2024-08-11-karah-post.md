Hi! My name is Karah! I was born in Jiangjin, China (right outside of Chongqing) and adopted when I was 17 months old. I am currently in Golden, Colorado, but I attend school at the University of Michigan! 

I grew up in a predominantly white area. It wasn’t until high school that I started to look more into my heritage as I met one of my best friends who was also adopted and as I developed greater feelings of identity disjuncture. Through meeting other Asian adoptees, as well as immersing myself in more Asian culture (whether it was movies, books, articles, communities, or foods), I was able to not only meet more Asian people but also reconnect with Asian customs. I still feel as though some aspects of my identity are hindered by either being raised in a white community or because I am Asian American, but living with these feelings and connecting with other people who might share similar feelings has helped me gain a better perspective about my adoptive experience. To me, identity is fluid. I think being adopted makes us inherently part of a unique community, and I’m so grateful to be a part of it. 

I am a rising junior studying nursing. Part of the reason I entered this field was to give back to under-resourced communities because I came from such a place. I feel lucky to have the opportunities I have, given my second chance through adoption, and I want to pay it forward. I am taking my first Intro to Asian Studies course this fall and could not be more excited! Currently, at university, I co-head a podcast club on campus that shares AAPI experiences. I enjoy cooking, hiking, going to concerts, and hanging out with friends! I’d absolutely love to connect with more people so please feel free to reach out!
