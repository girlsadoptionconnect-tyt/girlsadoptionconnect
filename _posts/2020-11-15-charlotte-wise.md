My name is Charlotte. I was adopted from Hunan, China in 2005 and moved to the United States. I have a younger sister who was also adopted from China, a few years later. I have been lucky enough to go back to China multiple times, and I even lived there for a bit. I have been learning Mandarin since elementary and want to continue learning about Chinese culture. I am super excited to hear everyone’s stories!
