Hi, my name is Mia. I was born in 1998 in Jiangxi, China. I was adopted by my mother when I was around 18 months old and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I currently live in Chicago! 

From the stories that I have heard from my mom, my birth mother wanted to make sure that I had a strong start to my life, so she kept me hidden and took care of me for a few months. After that, she left me on a sidewalk where she knew someone would find me. I was taken to an orphanage where I struggled to thrive, which resulted in me being placed in a foster home where I had one-on-one care.

Growing up, I never questioned my identity because, while I appeared different from the rest of my family, my parents worked hard to create an environment that made me feel like I was just like them. As I have reached my early twenties and with the pandemic, I have started to question my identity. The past two years I have really struggled with Asian imposter syndrome. While I do have a handful of friends that are also adoptees that I can talk to about it, I also joined different communities to connect with others so that I can also learn and grow.
