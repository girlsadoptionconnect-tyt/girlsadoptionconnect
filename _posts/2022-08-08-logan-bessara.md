Hi, my name is Logan. I was adopted from Nanchang, Jiangxi, China, when I was 10 months old.

Since then, I've been back to China to visit Jiangxi. There, I visited my finding spot. As a baby, I was left at and found on the staircase of a communication office building across from my orphanage. Today, the office building is no longer there, and it is an apartment building. My orphanage is also no longer there, and it's a market with different vendors.

I currently live in Hawaii, where many of the communities are of Asian descent. Because I was adopted by a Chinese family, I always had Chinese influences, therefore I've grown up celebrating Chinese traditions. I've also learned how to cook Chinese cuisine.
