    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>What is it?</strong><br>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>Causes</strong><br>
    These barriers are often rooted in racism and reinforced by stereotypes of Asian success and the Model Minority Myth.<br><br>
    This myth portrays Asian people as quiet, hardworking, studious, and rule-abiding.<br><br>
    As a result, Asian people may become invisible and overlooked in workplace leadership pipelines.<br><br>

    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    <strong>Bamboo ceiling & gender</strong><br>
    The “glass ceiling” refers to invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing to the same levels as men in the workplace.<br><br>
    Asian women often experience both the glass ceiling and the bamboo ceiling simultaneously.<br><br>
