      Gray background with pink and tan flowers. A white box centered on the slide contains the text:
      “Unpacking Imposter Syndrome in Adoptees.”

      <strong>Slide 2</strong><br>
      Pink background with gray and tan flowers. A white box displays the headline “Imposter Syndrome.”
      Text below explains: A psychological pattern where an individual doubts their accomplishments and has
      an internalized fear of being exposed as a “fraud.” Despite external evidence of competence, success is
      often attributed to luck rather than ability.

      <strong>Slide 3</strong><br>
      Pink background with gray and tan flowers. A white box explains that in adoptees, imposter syndrome
      may include conflict between cultural identities, which is more common in transnational adoptees.
      Adoptees may also express feelings of needing to belong or be loved.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide 4</strong><br>
      Pink background with gray and tan flowers. A white box states that imposter syndrome is linked to
      confidence. The more people look or sound like you, the more confident you may feel, which can
      significantly impact adoptees.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide 5</strong><br>
      Pink background with gray and tan flowers. A white box with the headline “Tips.”
