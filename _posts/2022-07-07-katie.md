Hi friends! My name is Katie, and I was born in Zhangzhou, China probably on May 22, 2004. I was left in a box with a blanket and a note. I was then put in an orphanage until my parents adopted me at 13 months old. I am now a senior in high school and want to become an occupational therapist.   

My parents adopted my two siblings: my little sister from Ethiopia and my little brother from the U.S.. Luckily, I have other siblings who don’t look like my parents, so I am always able to relate to someone. 

It is hard trying to connect with Chinese culture. My parents put me in Chinese school for a couple of years to hopefully learn Mandarin, but it never stuck. We celebrate Chinese New Year, and I wear my jade bracelet that I got on my 16th birthday.  

Since I was adopted at a young age, I don’t really have any memory of anything, other than the beautiful life my parents have provided. However, it is pretty obvious that I’m different than basically everyone else in my town. Thankfully, everyone has been accepting and they never judge or look down upon me because of my backstory.   

Outside of school, I like hanging out with my friends and family, shopping, and I work at a local ice cream shop!
