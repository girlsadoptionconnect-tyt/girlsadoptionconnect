<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    <strong>Overview: Adoptee DNA testing</strong><br>
    This series is meant to educate about DNA testing — not to promote or discourage it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>Why DNA test</strong><br>
    There are many reasons some adoptees decide to take a DNA test, especially adoptees from closed adoptions who don’t have access to information about their past. DNA testing might help adoptees:<br><br>
    • Learn medical history or genetic predispositions<br>
    • Understand ethnic origins<br>
    • Try to locate biological relatives
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>What to consider</strong><br>
    There are many things to consider before doing a DNA test. Some of these include:<br><br>
    • Whether you truly want answers to these questions<br>
    • How potential answers might affect you or your family<br>
    • Privacy concerns<br><br>
    If privacy is a main deterrent, you can register on DNA testing sites using an alias name.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>Start here</strong><br>
    <strong>23&amp;Me</strong><br>
    • Very popular among Chinese adoptees and people of Chinese heritage<br>
    • Saliva-based test<br>
    • Recommended starting point<br><br>
    <strong>AncestryDNA</strong><br>
    • Best used as a supplement to 23&amp;Me if possible<br>
    • Less popular among Chinese adoptees, but some families have found matches<br>
    • Saliva-based test
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide five</strong><br>
    <strong>GEDmatch</strong><br>
    Regardless of which DNA test you take, upload your results to GEDmatch.<br><br>
    • A global database of DNA tests<br>
    • May provide more matches than using 23&amp;Me or AncestryDNA alone<br>
    • Accepts uploads from 23&amp;Me and AncestryDNA free of charge<br>
    • At least 1,000 birth families from China are currently on GEDmatch
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    <strong>Also upload to…</strong><br>
    After taking 23&amp;Me and AncestryDNA tests, you can also upload your results to these Chinese platforms to increase the chances of finding a match:<br><br>
    <strong>23Mofang</strong><br>
    • Accepts 23&amp;Me and AncestryDNA uploads<br>
    • Database is kept in China<br>
    • Used by Nanchang Project and Roots of Love to DNA test birth families<br><br>
    <strong>WeGene</strong><br>
    • Accepts 23&amp;Me and AncestryDNA uploads<br>
    • Database is kept in China<br>
    • Very similar to 23Mofang — being in multiple databases increases match potential
  </li>
</ul>
