Hi! I'm Myah Mooney. I was adopted from Anhui, China when I was 10-years-old, and I grew up in Maui, Hawaii. 

I'm a proud graduate of King Kekaulike High School and The University of Hawaii at Manoa. I have studied abroad at Tongji University in Shanghai as well as at National Yang Ming University in Taiwan. I am a Boren scholarship recipient, which supported studying abroad. I am currently in Okinawa, Japan and am working for the U.S. Airforce.

I am a dragon boat paddler and a hula dancer. My team recently won a championship at Naha Hari as the first all-women’s team in dragon boat racing. I have also been dancing for various events, especially during AAPI heritage month. 

Nice to meet you (Aloha/Hajimemashite/很高兴认识你们)!
