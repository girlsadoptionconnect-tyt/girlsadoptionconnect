Hey everyone! My name is Kristen Pancoast. I was adopted from Jiangxi province in 2001 at 18 months old. I am currently 21 years old and live right outside of Philadelphia, PA. As of now, I am attending Thomas Jefferson University for nursing and expect to graduate in 2023. 

My immediate family consists of my mom, my dad, my older brother, and our two fur babies: Susie and Milo. Some fun facts about me: I have a tattoo on my arm in Chinese characters of my biological name (before I was adopted), my mother is Colombian so I’ve been raised in a pretty diverse household, and I hope to become a pediatric Neonatal Nurse practitioner in the future!
