It's almost 2025! In the past year, Girls Adoption Connect has shared 13 adoptees' spotlights, 12 informative posts about identity and reached over 2,000 members in the adoptee community. This year, Current Culture Connections was created and features over 40 Mandarin and Korean pieces. With the news of China ending international adoption, Girls Adoption Connect published exclusive Q&As from three agencies/non-profits who work on Chinese adoption. 

Given that 32 pieces have been published in the span of 50 weeks, Girls Adoption Connect will be resurfacing some of the year's highlights here and on Instagram stories. Starting tomorrow, and running through Dec. 31, tune in to revisit some of the highlights from the year!

Some of the pieces that will be resurfacing:

<ul>
  <li>Breaking the “Bamboo Ceiling”</li>
  <li>Adoptee Spotlight: Laura, 林浪</li>
  <li>Adoptee Spotlight: Madeline Chu</li>
</ul>
