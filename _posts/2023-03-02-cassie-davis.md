My name is Cassie, and I was adopted from foster care when I was 3-years-old. My biological parents married a month after placing me, and they continued to have a marriage for 19 years. They also raised my younger biological brother. His story is not mine to share, but he was told about me when he was 14-years-old; until then, he thought he was an only child.

I found my biological parents when I was 24-years-old. Post connection has not been easy. I had always wanted to find this family that I fit into, and, instead, I found more rejection. My biological mom has a very hard time being around me, let alone speaking to me. My biological dad and I are still figuring out how we fit in with one another. My biological brother and I have worked very hard, and we are now best friends.

My adoption was something I always struggled with. People-pleasing tendencies and the need to excel have guided my life path. Two years ago, I went back to school to become a registered counsellor. Now, I work with adoptees to help them heal adoption trauma, speak to social work teams about the importance of proper documentation and advocate for adoptees' rights in my province. I have found healing in using my voice and creating my own family with my husband, son and daughter.
