Hi, my name is Chloe. I was adopted in 2007 from Chongqing, China and was about 15 months old. I don't remember anything from when I was adopted; all I know is what my mom has told me. She said I was left on the front step of my orphanage in Chongqing.

Right now, I am a sophomore in high school. I was raised by a single mom and am so grateful for what she does everyday.  I am at a school that is very supportive of ethnic diversity, and I have a lot of friends who are very supportive and are always there for me. I am so glad to have friends and family who love me and care about me. I love to sing, dance and sometimes do school work. I especially love spending time with my family, whether it's getting together with my grandparents and uncle or just being with my mom; I love it.
