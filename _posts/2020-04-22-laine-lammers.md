I'm Laine Lammers. I was adopted in Changsha, China in 2005. I was adopted from the Youxian orphanage. I am the youngest of four children and the only adopted one in my family. I enjoy music, baking, biking and art. I'd love to learn more about where I'm from and hear more stories from people like me.
