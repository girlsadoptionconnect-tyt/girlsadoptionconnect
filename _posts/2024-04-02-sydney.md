Hello! My name is Sydney. I was adopted from Guangxi, China when I was 9-months-old and have lived in the United States since then. 

When I was young, I did not have a strong connection to other Chinese adoptees. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I got really invested in the adopted community. I attended Holt Camp online where I fostered some really great connections. I also was able to locate my entire adoption group and set up various video chats with them. This helped me feel more confident as a Chinese adoptee because I knew I wasn't alone in the struggles that I faced. It felt so good to hear that other adoptees share the same struggles I do in finding their identity. 

I attended Holt Camp in person when I was a senior in high school, and it was so nice being to finally meet some of the people I'd met at the online camp. It was a unique experience that I'm very thankful that I was able to take part in. 

I am currently in college where I'm studying biology. I hope to continue to advocate for other Chinese adoptees and foster connections between adoptees. I make it a goal each summer to meet up with someone from my adoption group. I am very thankful that I have found all of the supportive adoptee communities that I have.
