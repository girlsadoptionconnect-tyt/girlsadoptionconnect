It's almost 2022! In the past year, we have shared over 15 adoptees' spotlights, seven long-form stories and reached over 850 people. Besides this, we started adoption Q&As to hear short answers from members of the adoptee community and advocated for adoptee rights. 

Given that we have published 40 pieces over the span of 50 weeks, we will be resurfacing some of our year's highlights on our website and Instagram stories. Starting tomorrow, and running through Dec. 31, tune in to reread some of the highlights from the year!

Some pieces that will be resurfacing:

<ul>
  <li>Navigating My Chinese Identity</li>
  <li>Adoptee Spotlight: Keri Wenhua Busby</li>
  <li>What Adoptees Wish You Knew…</li>
  <li>Adoptee Spotlight: Kristen Pancoast</li>
</ul>
