<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    An overview of Ukrainian adoption during Russia’s invasion
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    Prior to the war with Russia, couples from the United States could internationally adopt, following most of the same procedures as they would with most international adoptions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    Families who were in the process of adopting when Russia invaded are unable to complete the adoption process. Many orphanages have evacuated to neighbouring countries but cannot access a Ukrainian judge to legalize the adoption. Children cannot obtain a United States immigrant visa without legalized adoption.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    Now, the only way for Ukrainian adoptees to come to the United States is for the U.S. federal government to allow the children into the country.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide five</strong><br>
    As the war broke out within the past few months, the United States government hasn’t released anything regarding families and children midway through the adoption and immigration process.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    Some organizations currently helping children in Ukraine:<br>
    UNICEF USA, Save the Children, SOS Children’s Villages, Doctors Without Borders, International Committee of the Red Cross, United Nations Refugee Agency
  </li>
</ul>
