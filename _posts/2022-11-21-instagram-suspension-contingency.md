This afternoon, Girls Adoption Connect's Instagram account was randomly suspended by Instagram. The slides above are all the information I currently have. As I’m locked out and in the appeal process, past, current, and upcoming content is safely backed up in my files. Depending on the outcome of the review, I’ll decide what to do going forward. Until then, posts will still be happening here on the website, and I’d appreciate it if you’ve had this happen to your account to reach out to me and let me know what you did.
