My name is Claire, and I am 15 years old. I was adopted from Yunnan province in May 2006 and brought to Chicago, IL. Though I have not been back to China, I try to immerse myself in Chinese culture and learn about my roots, but, of course, it can be challenging. 

Despite adoption being a huge part in my identity, it was only recently that I became invested in my adoption story, because I struggled to accept it as a child. In July 2020, I created Adoptees of China to give adoptees a space to express themselves and build a tight community. I’ve been able to form connections with other adoptees and it’s been quite empowering to meet so many adoptees that are able to understand me. Outside of school, I play tennis and viola. If I have free time, my favorite thing to do is some free writing or drawing while listening to music.
