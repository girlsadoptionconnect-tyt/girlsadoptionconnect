When my parents were traveling to China to adopt me from in 2005, they used Lotus Travel to help them plan their travel. Almost 20 years later, I’m honored to be able to help share their work in helping adoptees’ connect with their culture.

**Iris Culp, Lotus Travel:**

Lotus Travel is a travel agency that has supported the adoptive community for twenty+ years. Though we have offered adoptive family heritage travel to China, Vietnam & Cambodia for many years, in 2025, we are focused on developing programs that will serve the specific interests of adult adoptees. 


We recognize that adult adoptees have a wide range of experiences, desires and likely will have distinct preferences and priorities for China travel. So, we have created a short survey to gain input from adult adoptees about what matters most. We can offer the most cost-effective travel options when we more fully understand the highest-level preferences.  


This survey will take approximately 4 minutes to complete and can be anonymous, so there is no obligation or follow-up. If someone does wish to be notified of the overall results, you can receive the overall summarized results preferences after the survey is closed. There is no obligation on either of those choices.


I am Iris Culp, an educational and training consultant who works part-time with Lotus Travel. I am also an adoptive parent to two strongly opinionated adult adoptees who are both wrapping up their college careers. Louie Yi, owner of Lotus Travel, and I respect and value your opinion. 


If you have a few minutes to complete this survey, it would help us align any trip program best to match the priorities and preferences of adult adoptees.
