<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    On September 4, the U.S. Department of State announced that China is officially ending its international adoption program. According to the State Department, China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs has completed processing adoptions that already received travel authorization. Moving forward, no additional cases will be processed unless they involve blood relatives within three generations.<br><br>
    This news is still developing, and more information about how this may or may not impact adoptees will hopefully be shared soon. This announcement may bring a wide range of emotions — all of which are valid.

    <strong>China – Announcement from the People’s Republic of China Ministry of Civil Affairs Regarding Intercountry Adoptions</strong><br>
    September 4, 2024<br><br>

    Dear Adoption Service Providers,<br><br>

    Please share the following information with families in the process of adopting from the People’s Republic of China (PRC):<br><br>

    Dear families,<br><br>

    The Department of State received notification from the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs stating that beginning August 28, 2024, civil affairs departments across China will no longer carry out foreign adoption work, except for cases involving foreigners adopting stepchildren or children of collateral relatives within three generations.<br><br>

    The Ministry of Civil Affairs confirmed verbally that this policy applies to all pending adoptions as well as future cases, with the exception noted above. All cases with previously issued travel authorizations have been completed. No cases at any other stage will continue to be processed.<br><br>

    The Department of State acknowledged the devastation this news may cause families who have waited years and expressed their commitment to transparency and continued communication as more information becomes available.<br><br>

    Sincerely,<br>
    The Office of Children’s Issues<br>
    Bureau of Consular Affairs<br>
    U.S. Department of State

    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>Context</strong><br>
    China has been gradually slowing international adoption since 2006. With the One-Child Policy in place from 1979 to 2015, China now faces a population shortage. To address this, China transitioned to two-child and three-child policies, resulting in fewer children being placed in orphanages.<br><br>
    From 2020 to 2024, China paused international adoption due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Even before this pause, international adoption rates were declining, with most children placed internationally having medical needs or disabilities.<br><br>

    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>A note from Girls Adoption Connect</strong><br>
    As this news continues to unfold, it remains unclear how — or if — it will impact adoptees who have already been adopted, including birth family searches, homeland tours, and related services. Girls Adoption Connect remains committed to amplifying adoptee voices and advocating for clarity and accountability.<br><br>
    This news may bring a wide range of emotions. It certainly did for me when I first learned. During this time, I encourage our community to take space to process, connect with one another, and remember that all of our feelings are valid.<br><br>
    — Téa Tamburo, Founder of Girls Adoption Connect
