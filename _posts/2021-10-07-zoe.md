Hi! My name is Zoe, and I am going into my second year at University at St. Andrews, where I am studying classical studies. I was adopted from Jiangxi province in China at 10 months old, and I live in the U.K. with my mum and younger sister, who is also adopted from China.

I grew up with Chinese adoptees around me but have been the most interested in discussing and talking about adoption. However, the schools I attended were predominately white, so, although I felt no different from the other children, I stood out in appearance. I often had to deal with questions about where I am from. Although it can be tiresome, it has taught me to be open and straight-to-the-point about who I am.

Recently, I have become a lot more involved in the adoptee community by meeting more adoptees and also, with friends, setting up a society at our university for adoptees. Along with this, my friend and I started @voicesofadoption_, on Instagram, to create a space for people to share their experiences of what it's like growing up adopted, in hopes of helping others feel they are not alone. It has been a rewarding experience to see adoptees voices being heard.
