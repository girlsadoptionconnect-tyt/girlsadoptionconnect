*In honor of suicide prevention month...*

My name is Jiji Fink. I was adopted from China at two years old. Throughout my life, people told me I’ve been a happy person. What I haven’t told most people is that deep down I have depression. I always had low self esteem, frustrations, and outbursts of tears. I never knew why I felt sad all the time, nor did I know how to handle my emotions.

I moved into college about two weeks ago, and the transition has been very hard for me. I would cry every night, call my parents, and have dark thoughts wishing I was dead so I wouldn’t have to deal with the pain.

However, my parents have supported me throughout the hard times and found a therapist for me, so that I can get the right help. It was a bit of a struggle to tell them at first, but, once I did, things started to feel a little better. I know that with the right medications, counseling and support, I will feel better and I will always give it my all in life!
