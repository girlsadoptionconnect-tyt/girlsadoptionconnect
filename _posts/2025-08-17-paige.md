Hi, my name is Paige! I was born in Youyang City, Chongqing, China, and was adopted when I was two years old. Growing up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, I always knew I was adopted, and I learned to get to know my culture and my home in China. I am the baby of my family, where I have two older sisters and brothers.

As a kid, it was a little difficult for me in school because I had to learn a whole new language, and it took me until the age of 6 to somewhat speak and understand English. School was always very hard because of the English language, and also, many people were not friendly towards me because I was Chinese. I learned to overcome any kind of negativity that relates to my culture and where I’m from, and to only focus on the positive side of it. 

What I love to do is listening to music and running. I also enjoy learning Mandarin, and I love to learn about my culture and its history. During the summers, I go to Adopteen. It’s so much fun, and I make so many friends who are also from China. It’s a great community that I have surrounded myself with. I go in so excited to meet everyone, and I learn so much by the time I leave each year.
