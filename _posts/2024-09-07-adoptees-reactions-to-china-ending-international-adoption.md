<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Slide one:</strong><br>
      Adoptees’ responses to China ending international adoption.<br>
      Quotes are unedited and not fact-checked.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide two:</strong><br>
      Quotes
      <ul>
        <li>“Still processing it. Filled with wonder and sadness too. I think it's grief of my past.”</li>
        <li>“Honestly I don't know how to react. All I could say was, wow.”</li>
        <li>“Shocked, but not surprised. They were slowly phasing out international adoption.”</li>
        <li>“I think it's really sad to know that there are so many kids still in orphanages across China. And that for some families who may have already been matched with a child are not able to get them.”</li>
        <li>“It's weird to think I'm in the last generation of Chinese adoptees.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide three:</strong><br>
      Quotes
      <ul>
        <li>“I hope China can acknowledge us in the future like South Korea has for their adoptees.”</li>
        <li>“I saw the news come in. Very mixed emotions, confusion, worry, sympathy, and then hurt.”</li>
        <li>“I'm worried about what this means for adoptees searching for bio parents and family.”</li>
        <li>“I think it's good, the end of an era and I'm happy for those kids who can grow up in their homeland.”</li>
        <li>“Wondering if we can still visit and search for birth family...”</li>
        <li>“Definitely closes a huge chapter for all of us since there will be no more Chinese adoptees.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide four:</strong><br>
      Quotes
      <ul>
        <li>“Sad, since I was an international adoptee. They shouldn't close it.”</li>
        <li>“I'm conflicted. Happy that other kids will be raised with people who look like them but sad when I remember going to adopt my sister and thinking how we'd maybe never know each other otherwise.”</li>
        <li>“My immediate reaction is sadness. I wish the adoption process wasn't politicized.”</li>
        <li>“I think it's good because young people can either be adopted within China or remain with their birth family.”</li>
        <li>“I'm honestly not super surprised that they did this. I have questions though.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Slide five:</strong><br>
      Quotes
      <ul>
        <li>“I hope the reasons are because families are able to keep their children.”</li>
        <li>“Saddened for families waiting.”</li>
        <li>“It feels sudden even though China has been struggling with population decline for years.”</li>
        <li>“Strange to know I’m from the last couple of years of Chinese adoption that’ll happen.”</li>
        <li>“I hope China and the U.S. answer our questions about how this could impact those already adopted.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
