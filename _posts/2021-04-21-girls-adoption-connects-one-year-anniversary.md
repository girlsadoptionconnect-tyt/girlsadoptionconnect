As of today, Girls Adoption Connect is a year old! G.A.C. was started with the hopes of connecting adoptees and sharing our stories of adoption. Since then, we have collaborated with other platforms, explore own identity and amplified the experiences of the adopted community. So to all that have supported us throughout the past year, thank you.
