Hi, my name is Anica (she/her), and I was adopted from Anhui, China around 2000. I’m taking a break in the middle of my undergraduate journey and currently live in California. 

I love hearing perspectives from transracial and international adoptees in conversations, inside and outside adoption. I’m super happy to see adoptees come together, because I didn’t grow up with anyone to relate with.
