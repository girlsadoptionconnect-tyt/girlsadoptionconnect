Hello, my name is Ellen Moody, and my Chinese name is Xiao Li. I was born in Sichuan, China, and a police man found me when I was a baby and brought me to an orphanage called Nanchong No. 1 Social Welfare Institute. I do not know anything about my birth parents, but I would like to one day. My dad and my cousin came to China and adopted me when I was around 11 months old. 

My parents were always very open to talking about adoption, and they answered all the questions they knew the answers to that I had for them when I was young. I also have two sisters, one older and one younger, who are also adopted from China (we are not blood related.) I am very interested in connecting with my birth family one day. Currently I'm studying music and German at the Bob Cole Conservatory at California State Long Beach.
