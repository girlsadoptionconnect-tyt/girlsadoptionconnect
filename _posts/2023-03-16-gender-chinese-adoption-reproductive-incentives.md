<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    <strong>Gender, Chinese Adoption & Reproductive Incentives</strong><br>
    Women’s History Month 2023.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>The one-child policy</strong><br>
    In 1979, the Chinese government implemented a policy that only allowed couples to raise one child.<br><br>
    At the time, only boys were expected to care for their parents in old age.<br><br>
    This led to a disproportionate number of girls being left at orphanages and eventually placed for adoption.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    <strong>Gender in China</strong><br>
    The one-child policy was designed to curb the country’s rapid population growth.<br><br>
    Today, China faces a significant gender imbalance between boys and girls.<br><br>
    Gender norms and expectations contributed to this issue. Girls were expected to marry out of the family and not provide the same retirement security that a son would.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    <strong>Chinese adoptees</strong><br>
    About 110,000 children have been adopted from China, with most going to the United States.<br><br>
    The number of adopted girls greatly outnumbers adopted boys: 86% to 14%.<br><br>
    Most Chinese girl adoptees were left as babies and adopted between the ages of one and two.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide five</strong><br>
    <strong>Some gendered impacts of the one-child policy</strong><br>
    Female babies were disproportionately subjected to abandonment and infanticide.<br><br>
    Women’s reproductive rights were dictated for decades, with many forced to undergo sterilizations or abortions.<br><br>
    There was a large rise in female adoption to the United States.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    <strong>Current Chinese reproduction incentives & maternity status</strong><br>
    China is creating economic and financial rewards for having children.<br><br>
    Beijing is now offering incentives for married women to have babies.<br><br>
    Some believe China may begin factoring motherhood into workplace promotions for women.
  </li>
