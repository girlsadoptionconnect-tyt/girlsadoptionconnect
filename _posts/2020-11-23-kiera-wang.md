Hi, my name is Keira. I was adopted from Hunan, China, when I was 8 months old. I now live in St. Paul, MN. My parents are Chinese as well, but they were born in the U.S.. I have a younger brother named Kenji who is 13. I'm currently 15, and my birthday is January 8th. Some things I enjoy are running and hanging out with friends. 

When I was in 5th grade, I visited China which was a super cool experience! I’m really happy to have been able to connect with other girls who were adopted at the same time as I was. Love you guys!💕
