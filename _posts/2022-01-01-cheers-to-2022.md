Téa: Happy New Year, everyone! Coming to you from Girls Adoption Connect, I am Téa here to wish you a very happy start to your 2022. This last year has been incredible getting to reach so many amazing people through Girls Adoption Connect and getting to share adoptee voices and advocate for adoption rights. We are planning to continue on doing this in the new year by sharing adoption spotlights, adoption rights, diversity, equity and inclusion and a lot more, so stay tuned for that. Never in a million years when I started Girls Adoption Connect did I imagine that it would reach so many amazing people. I honestly, when I started it, expected to reach around 15 people: just the people that I was adopted alongside. So that has been amazing, and thank you so much for the opportunity to share my story as an adoptee and get to share and advocate for adoptive voices over the last year and a half. That's something I look forward to continuing to do in 2022. So now onto hearing from adoptees in our community about what the goals are for 2022.

Katie: Hi, I'm Katie. And for the new year, I would like to be able to meet new people and communicate with new people. I'm very excited for the new year. 

Claire: Hi everyone. My name is Claire. I'm 16 years old. I am adopted from Yunnan, China, and I am from Dallas, Texas. But I'm currently in Chicago visiting my home state. In 2022 I'm really hoping to get involved more in the community adoption community, post more and host even more events to get to know other people and hopefully share even more stories in the coming year. So I wish you guys all the best of luck in the next year, and I'll see you soon.

Iris: Hi, everyone. So for 2022 I have a few goals. The main ones are just to continue finding an adoptee community wherever I go and to finish my master's thesis. And I guess finally just to stay healthy and happy throughout this next year. It'll be challenging, but we can do it. So Happy New Year everyone. Bye.
