<h4>Slide descriptions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    On a darker pink to light pink ombre background, there are dark pink and white clouds in the corners. Three rectangles in white, pink, and gray appear across the slide. Purple text across the rectangles reads “The Adoptee Citizenship Act of 2021.” Smaller text below reads “(and how you can help).”
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    On a purple and pink ombre background with pink and white clouds in the corners, a white box contains a purple headline reading “What it is.” Smaller gray text explains that the Adoptee Citizenship Act (ACA) is a bill seeking to ensure internationally adopted and biological children are treated equally under the law. The ACA would provide automatic U.S. citizenship to adoptees adopted by American parents.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide three</strong><br>
    On a light pink and dark pink ombre background with pink and white clouds in the corners, a white box contains a purple headline reading “Why it’s important (Part 2).” Smaller gray text explains that passing the ACA would close a loophole in the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (CCA), which denies citizenship to adoptees who were 18 or older in February 2001 despite being legally adopted by U.S. citizens and raised in the United States.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide four</strong><br>
    On a pink and purple ombre background with purple and white clouds in the corners, a white box contains a purple headline reading “Why it’s important (Part 1).” Smaller gray text explains that international adoptees who were 18 on February 27, 2001, were excluded from automatic citizenship under the CCA. As a result, thousands are unable to vote, receive full government benefits, or are subject to deportation. Passing the ACA would grant citizenship to adoptees who currently do not qualify.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide five</strong><br>
    On a purple and light pink ombre background with pink, purple, and white clouds in the corners, a white box contains a purple headline reading “Who introduced the ACA.” Smaller gray text lists U.S. Senators Susan Collins, Roy Blunt, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Lisa Murkowski, and Tammy Duckworth as the sponsors of the Adoptee Citizenship Act of 2021.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide six</strong><br>
    On a pink and white ombre background with pink, purple, and white clouds in the corners, a white box contains a purple headline reading “How you can help.” Gray text outlines three points: listen to adoptees and amplify their voices; contact representatives and senators using adopteesforjustice.org and adopteecitizenshipact.org; and share the post to reach more people.
  </li>
