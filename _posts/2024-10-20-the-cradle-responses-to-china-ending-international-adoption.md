*Response obtained from an email interview between Girls Adoption Connect and leadership from The Cradle. Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.*

**As an organization helping families adopt children internationally, did you anticipate the end of international Chinese adoption? What was your reaction when it was announced?**

“Early in the pandemic, China announced it was putting its intercountry adoption programs on hold. This was presumably due to infection control practices and restrictions with travel. As each year after 2020 passed and there were no updates from China and things remained on hold, The Cradle worked with each family that had been in the process or were considering China. Our counselors helped families consider their goals, hopes and the possible outcomes. All Cradle families had decided to pursue other country programs or alternative paths to parenting more than a year ago. As an agency that cares about the well-being of children, we are saddened but not surprised by China’s announcement.”

**Many Chinese adoptees are uncertain as to how this news could affect their search for biological family members or taking homeland tours. How do you see this news affecting/not affecting already-adopted Chinese adoptees?**

“We are hopeful that this change in future practice will not limit the opportunities for adoptees to connect with birth family, birth country and birth culture. We understand and believe that those are all important aspects of an adopted person’s identity.”

**What’s your organization doing to support children still in orphanages in China?**

“The Cradle provides pre and post adoption services to families adopting internationally. We don’t have an office or a presence in countries outside the United States. We, along with our partners at NCFA, advocate with the Department of State to learn more from China about their plans for the children who are in an institutional setting and the families who were caught mid-process. We believe children deserve to be raised in a permanent, loving family.”

**Is there anything else you’d like the Chinese adoptee community to know?**

“News such as China’s announcement can bring up complex thoughts and feelings for people who were adopted, especially those adopted from China. The Cradle’s post-adoption services are available to offer guidance and support. Visit https://cradle.org/lifelong-support/counseling-sessions/ or call 1-847-475-5800 to inquire about post-adoption support.”
