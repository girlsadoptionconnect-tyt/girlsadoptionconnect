Slide descriptions:

Slide one: Gray quatrefoil background with a pale pink box in the center. Large dark gray text reads "How do you celebrate your gotcha day?" A faint gray line moves vertically. Small gray text in all capitals: traditions from adoptees and their families.

Slide two: Pale pink quatrefoil background. In a light gray box with a pink boarder is text from an individual person. We always talk about the story of my parents getting me and seeing me for the first time, Jaelin. I usually have a cake. Some years I write letters on a balloon or in a bottle and let it go, Lily. We usually get Chinese food. It's not much but a great way to get takeout, Monica.

Slide three: Slide two: Pale pink quatrefoil background. In a light gray box with a pink boarder is text from an individual person. Chinese food with my ma, Kamma. My family always calls it "Forever Family Day." My mom used to buy me a charm, that was relevant to my adoption and would add them to a bracelet. Now, my parents and I usually get Chinese food for dinner. My mom and I also have matching necklaces that read "forever family" that we wear, Téa.

Slide four: Pale pink quatrefoil background. In a light gray box with a pink boarder is text from an individual person. Exactly like a birthday! But the gifts are more family-centered, and we do family activities like all go out to eat or go to the museum, Charlotte. I talk about and post my story on my social media accounts, Logan.
