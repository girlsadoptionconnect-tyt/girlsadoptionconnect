Hi! My name is Meika (me-ka), and I was adopted from the small city, Jingdezhen, in Jiangxi, China when I was 13 months old. I was flown to Beijing to meet my parents. I am now 25 years old and live in Ontario, Canada.

I grew up in a small white town and never embraced my Chinese identity, even though my parents tried. My peers were all white, and I emerged myself into white culture to fit in. I had experienced microaggressions and racism my whole life, which pushed me even further away from my Chinese culture.

When I moved to the city for university, I experienced cultural shock by seeing a large diversity of people. I continue to struggle with my Chinese identity, but I am starting to connect with other transracial adoptees, as it’s nice to have others to relate to.

I am finishing up my Bachelor of social work! I really enjoy my two cats, traveling, reading, hiking, water activities and exploring new restaurants. Please reach out if you want to connect with me!
