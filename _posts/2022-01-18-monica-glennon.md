Hello! My name is Monica Glennon. I am 19 years old and am a Junior at Coastal Carolina University. My major is Early Childhood Education, and I plan to pursue a Bachelors in Early Childhood Education and my Masters in Special Education. I am originally from Upstate NY, but currently I live full time in Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

I was born in Foshan City, Guangdong Province. I was adopted in 2004 by my wonderful single mother. Growing up was hard mostly because I was trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted to be in the future. I always knew that I was adopted and I took that in stride because it’s an important part of my life. My mother was so open and supportive in every question I had about my adoption. When people get to know me I always tell them that I am an Asian American adoptee.

Why? Because I’m proud. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t adopted. I wouldn’t have met my mother. I wouldn’t have done anything that made me who I am today. I know my biological family gave me up, but they helped me find my family: my mother and my two sisters. I know I can’t fit into everything, but I do know who I am and what I want to do. I am a proud Asian American adoptee who had some challenges in their life, but overcame them. I know there will be more, but I’m glad to have my experiences shape my present and future.
