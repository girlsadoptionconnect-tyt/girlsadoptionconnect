Hey! I’m Rose Margolies. I was adopted from Jiangxi, China when I was 14 months old and was raised in Westchester, New York. I don’t have any memories from my time in China, but I have been told that my birth mother held on to me for a couple months before giving me up for adoption.

Growing up, I felt confident in who I was as an Asian American adoptee. Part of this confidence came from meeting and becoming friends with other Chinese adoptees, which my parents made sure of, and I am forever thankful for this. I do sometimes feel lingering eyes on me when I’m in public with my white parents, but I choose to ignore the stares, instead surrounding myself with accepting and caring friends and family.

I have chosen not to take a DNA test or look for my birth parents, because I don’t feel that information is useful to me. I believe that my experiences and the relationships I have with the people around me make up who I am. Being an adoptee is one important part of my story, but not my entire identity.

Now, I am almost 18 years old and will be attending Wesleyan University in the fall. I am excited to continue my life’s journey as an Asian American adoptee.
