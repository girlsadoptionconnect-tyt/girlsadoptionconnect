In the summer of 2018, my family and I travelled back to China to see where we began our journey as a family, back in September 2005. I do not have much information on my life pre-adoption, so I went into this trip hoping to learn more about myself and my past. I did not expect to learn much; my adoption was over a decade ago, and I wasn't sure what records the orphanage would have. I didn't know if they'd even remember me. 

I've grown up knowing I was adopted and the story of my adoption. My parents told me everything they knew, even though there wasn't much. They also shared with me stories about the process of adopting me and their trip to China to meet me. Returning to these same locations 13 years later was mainly intended to reminisce and for me to better understand what they experienced when we became a family. 
## Guangzhou
In 2018, my family and I travelled back to China to see where we began our journey as a family, back in 2005. I was born in Hunan, Changsha, but my parents and I travelled through Guangzhou to finalize my adoption. Our first stop was Guangzhou, where we explored the city and Shamian Island.
