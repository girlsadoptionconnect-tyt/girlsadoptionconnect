Hi! My name is Mia (she/her), and I was adopted when I was fourteen months from Jiangxi province in China in September 2004. I was born in Yichun city but first met my adopted parents in Nanchang. I currently live in Seattle, Washington. Since I was adopted, I’ve been back to China twice. I hope to travel to China again in the future. 

This past August, I launched Sisters of China, an organization dedicated to connecting female Chinese adoptees. We have monthly virtual meetings. In my free time I love cooking/baking, hiking, and listening to music. I’m so excited to hear all of your stories!
