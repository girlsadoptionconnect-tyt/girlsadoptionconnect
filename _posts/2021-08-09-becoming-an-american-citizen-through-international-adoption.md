Generally, U.S. citizenship is acquired when a parent finalizes the adoption in the United States. That process was very similar when I was adopted in 2005, from Hunan, China, by American parents. I was nine months old when I was adopted, so I was unable to sign any documentation, thus all the paperwork and legal forms were signed with my parents’ names. 

The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (CCA) grants children adopted by American citizens automatic U.S. citizenship; this is the legislation that granted me immediate citizenship when I arrived. However, there were a lot of steps that made this possible. 

To become a U.S. citizen by adoption or biological, one must have at least one parent who is a citizen by birth or naturalization, in the custody of the parent, and be in the U.S. as a permanent resident. This process would have not have been possible for me had my adoption not been legalized before I came home. 

By the time my parents and I met in Changsha, they were confirmed as my adoptive family. In Guangzhou, we filed the requests for my visa and passport. Given that I was not yet a U.S. citizen, I was given a temporary Chinese passport that I moved to the U.S. with. Since I wasn’t able to go home, to Chicago, without either document, we stayed in Guangzhou for several days.
