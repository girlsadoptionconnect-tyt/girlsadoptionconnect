Hey everyone! My name is Kaitie, and I'm a sophomore enrolled at San Jose State University with a major of public health! My interests include music, gaming and getting boba! 

I was adopted from Fuling, China, and, for me, it was kind of neutral; I didn’t really have a feeling about my adoption. I was adopted at 10 months old, so I don’t remember much of anything. But nowadays, I feel like it’s just a part of life and it doesn’t matter where you come from. My family got me in 2001 and we went back for my sister in 2005.

With this feeling of being detached from the Chinese community, finding Girls Adoption Connect was really exciting! I'm looking forward to meeting new adoptees and exchanging stories as well as making some new friends.
