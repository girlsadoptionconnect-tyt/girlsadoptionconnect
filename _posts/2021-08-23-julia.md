Hi, my name is Julia, and I was adopted in 2004, when I was a year old. I was raised in the Xiangyin county, SWI, in Hunan province, China, and have grown up in Spain. I'm an only child and feel lucky, since I've grown up in a town with many other adoptees and have been treated like a white person. However, this also scares me since I don't know how it will affect me if I move to bigger city.

I've always been interested to learn about other people's adoption journey, specially the ones raised in the same orphanage as myself. Last year, I decided to start a roots search. In Spain, there aren't many resources, so I had to reach information from American people. That's one of the reasons why this year my friends and I decided to start an adoption account on Instagram called @unavision_diferente, which will be done in Spanish and English. With it, I want to change the vision that many people have about adoption and make a place where adoptees can feel comfortable talking about adoption.
