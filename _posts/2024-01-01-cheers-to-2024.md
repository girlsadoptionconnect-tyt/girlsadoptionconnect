## Wishing you a Happy New Year from Girls Adoption Connect!

The past year has been a turbulent one for the Asian and adopted community. We entered the year finding that the Adoptee Citizenship Act didn't pass Congress, learned more about China's gender imbalance, and some of us were at the center of the affirmative action debate. Through all of this, I've had the utmost privilege of hosting this page to raise awareness and amplify our collective voices as adoptees.

Over the past year, it's been a joy to be a part of uniting the adopted community. To everyone who have been supportive along the way: thank you for the opportunity to share my story as an adoptee and for the privilege of amplifying and advocating for adoptees' voices the past three and a half years. As we progress into the new year, more adoptees' spotlights and adoption content will be forthcoming. Cheers to 2024!

Love, 

Téa Tamburo, Girls Adoption Connect founder
