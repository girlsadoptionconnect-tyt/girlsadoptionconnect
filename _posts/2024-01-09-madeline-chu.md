Hi! My name is Madeline, and I was found in Zhenjiang, Guangdong, China. According to my records, when I was 8-days-old I was abandoned at the gate of Taiping Town, Zhanjiang City's government building on Sept. 7, 2004. I was adopted when I was 10-months-old into an Asian American family. We moved around a bit when growing up, but we eventually settled within the Midwest region in the United States.

I grew curious about the identity of "transracial adoptees" through opportunities of personal growth and exploration of identities. Navigating this complex emotional journey has allowed me to embark on the journey to reconnect with my origins and to surround myself with individuals of similar backgrounds and diverse experiences. With my awareness of challenges increasing as I grew up, my desire to engage in local equity campaigns grew fiercer, as it reflected the need to uplift a community that I always wished was represented in a positive manner.

Currently, I am studying International Affairs with a minor in Asian Studies. I'm primarily focusing on advocacy toward the provision of equity in education and society for marginalized communities. I always wish to see things in a more positive light and strive to build that intensity even further, to virtually see this dream.
