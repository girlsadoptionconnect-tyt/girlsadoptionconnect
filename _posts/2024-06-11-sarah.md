Hello! My name is Sarah, and my Chinese name is 金燕威 (Jīnyànwēi). I was adopted when I was one year old in May 2005 in Guangxi, China. I now live in Michigan.

When I was six years old, my parents enrolled me in a Chinese immersion program. Despite learning Mandarin, I never felt Chinese enough and struggled with my identity, especially when I discovered my citizenship had never been finalized. Legally, my name was still YànWēi, and I was forced to start using it for homework assignments, my driver’s license, and other official documents. At that time, my Chinese name made me feel uncomfortable and separated from others because it was different.

However, as I grew older, I began to appreciate my name and felt a sense of belonging within the AAPI communities by joining clubs and participating in cultural events. This year, I helped plan AAPI Heritage Month events at The University of Michigan, which made me feel more connected to my community.

Currently, I am entering my fourth year of undergraduate studies and am majoring in Asian Studies and minoring in Translation Studies and Asian American Pacific Islander Studies. I hope to continue my journey and possibly become a translator or pursue a career in international relations.
