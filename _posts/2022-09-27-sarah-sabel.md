Hi everyone! My name is Sarah Sabal, and I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. And yes, I love spicy food, especially ma-la (麻辣) hotpot! My Chinese name is long-xiuying. I was left as a newborn baby by the police station. I was in an orphanage and lived with two different foster families until my parents adopted me at age seven. Now, I am an undergraduate college student with double majors in Marketing and Chinese at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am getting ready to move to Taiwan to study abroad for a semester!

I grew up in China for the first seven years, remembering my early childhood, and I never knew there was another world I would live in for the rest of my life. I knew some Sichuan dialects but lost most of them when I came to the United States, when I had to learn English. It was a cultural shock for a young child to go from living in Sichuan to living in the United States. I experienced challenges growing up in simultaneously learning English and Chinese, social norms and living in both cultures.

From my childhood to my first year of college, I always felt the need to fit in with my friends and peers in school. It is because I lived in a small, predominantly white hometown with a lack of diversity. As a result, I did not have much exposure to my heritage, and I was not interested, because I wanted to be an "American country girl." However, it changed during the summer of 2021 when I was getting ready to go to South Korea with my friend. That was when I realized how much I miss my home country, the taste of spicy food, and the familiarity of growing up in a homogenous society where everyone shared the same culture. That is when I started to embrace my identity of living in two different worlds and wanting to learn more about my heritage.

I recently took a 23&me DNA test in hopes of finding my birth family, but I got the opportunity to learn more about myself. My result showed that I am mostly Chinese and some Korean. My family has been very supportive throughout my life journey and is excited for my new chapter in Taiwan.
