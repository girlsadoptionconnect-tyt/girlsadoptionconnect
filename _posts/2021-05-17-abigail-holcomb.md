Hello, my name is Abigail Holcomb. I am from Hubei, Wuhan, China. I'm the oldest of 4 siblings. 3 of them are from China and 1 is from North Carolina. I love to read romance, WWII, and Chinese history books. I also draw, paint, and bake. 

Adoption has really affected my life throughout school, because people just didn't understand why I ate different things. I'm a Christian and those are my friends I really associate with. I have learned that adoption affects each of my siblings differently.
