My name is Delia. I was adopted when I was two years old from Ganzhou, China. I grew up in Louisiana but now live in Colorado, so I can pursue my Doctorate of Physical Therapy degree. I was able to visit China in 2009 with my friends from the orphanage and their families. We had a great time seeing China and the orphanage we came from! 

Growing up, I loved competing in gymnastics but now I found a love for listening to other people’s stories. When I’m not studying for school, I’m coaching gymnastics or on a hike with my dog.
