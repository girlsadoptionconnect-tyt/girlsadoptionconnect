Hey everyone, my name is Grace White. I was adopted from China at 15 months. I am the youngest of two children. my older brother is my parents' biological son. I always knew I was adopted. Within my family, my mom's side, I had two cousins that are also adopted and had girls from my adoption group. I love reading, writing, doing art, as well as cooking. I also love animals and have been riding horses since I was three years old. 

I always wanted to connect with other adoptees because I always wonder what feelings and opinions we have similarity and different. I have been here in the US for 15 years now! I haven’t went back to my birth country yet but I hope someday I can and I would be able to as well as ready. I look forward to hearing other people’s stories.
