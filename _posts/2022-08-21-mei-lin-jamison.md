Hello my name is Mei-Lin Jamison, and I was adopted from Goazhou province when I was 14 months old. Since then, I’ve been living in the United States with my parents in a small area.

When I was adopted I was very ill and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. This made me feel very alone in my hometown, because I didn’t look like my parents and I was disabled. Other than this, I am a typical teenage girl. At 18 years old now, being adopted by my parents I think is the best thing to have happened to me. Everyone asks about my biological parents but never asks how amazing my parents are. I am grateful for them everyday. My parents do not treat me like I’m any less of a daughter, because we do not share a blood-relationship. 

Currently, I'm working on earning a degree in psychology to do research on mental illnesses. I also speak about my mental health, trauma, disability and adoption on social media. My life is not perfect but it’s mine and I'm proud of that.
