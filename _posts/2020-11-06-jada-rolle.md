Hello, my name is Jada. I was adopted from Hunan, China in 2005. I came to the United Sates when I was eight months old, and I have two brothers. I am the middle child and the only Asian person in my family. I have never been back to China, but I’ve tried to learn Chinese and more about my culture. I enjoy sports, music, photography and traveling. I hope someday I can meet more adoptees in person and learn about their stories.
