<h4>Slide text</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Slide one</strong><br>
    <strong>Savior complex</strong><br>
    When someone believes that the act of adopting a child is heroic and, therefore, the adoptive parent is a hero who should be praised for their “good deed” of adopting.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Slide two</strong><br>
    <strong>Realities</strong><br>
    Children don’t usually need to be “rescued” or “saved” through adoption. Rather, adoption is about creating a family and giving a child permanent love.
  </li>
</ul>
