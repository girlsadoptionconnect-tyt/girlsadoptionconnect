My name is Lena, and I am an adoptee from Jiangxi, China. I was found by my foster parents in a cardboard box on the side of a road near a busy street. The box also contained a paper slip that had my birthdate, which was also the name I was given by my birth parents. Once I was sent to the orphanage, I was adopted by my mom in America! 

Something I’ve been struggling with in my adoption is finding the space to accept the trauma and loss that comes with it, even if I didn’t know my birth parents at all. In a lot of ways I am thankful to my mom, who, as a single parent, raised me. I’ve grown up in a loving Chinese American household and had so many opportunities handed to me that I would not have been given otherwise. I'm currently searching for my birth parents through Facebook groups and DNA testing sites!
